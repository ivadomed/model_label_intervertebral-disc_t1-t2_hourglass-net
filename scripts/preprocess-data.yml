# The subjecst below are skipped for the following reasons:
#   - ucdavis: These subjects have no corresponding ground truth label files
#   - brnoUhb: These subjects have larger images. Processing with "jobs: 4"
#              causes my computer to run out of memory, so it's easiest to
#              process them separately.
